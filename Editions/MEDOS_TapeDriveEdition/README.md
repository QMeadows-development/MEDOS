[View the project here (coming soon)](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_TapeDriveEdition/)

MEDOS Tape Drive Edition is an edition of MEDOS meant to act as an operating system for external Tape drives. It will also have support for having an Internet connection, and also with the correct hardware, the ability to use your tape drive remotely without plugging it in. A special piece of hardware needs to be added that includes a battery and an antenna.

It is designed to act as an operating system for tape drives of capacities of 40 megabytes (40,000 kilobytes, 40,000,000 bytes) to 400 terabytes (400,000 Gigabytes, 400,000,000 Megabytes, 400,000,000,000 kilobytes, 400,000,000,000,000 bytes) (the current physical limit of consumer Tape Drives Drives)

It will need a controller to be able to be ran with the hardware upgrade.

This edition of MEDOS is coming soon
