# MEDOS SSD (Solid State Drive) edition

[View the project here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_SSD/)

MEDOS SSD Edition is an edition of MEDOS meant to act as an operating system for external Solid State drives. It will also have support for having an Internet connection, and also with the correct hardware, the ability to use your hard drive remotely without plugging it in. A special piece of hardware needs to be added that includes a battery and an antenna.

It is designed to act as an operating system for solid state drives of capacities of 80 megabytes (80,000 kilobytes, 80,000,000 bytes) to 100 terabytes (100,000 Gigabytes, 100,000,000 Megabytes, 100,000,000,000 kilobytes, 100,000,000,000,000 bytes) (the current physical limit of consumer Solid State Drives)

It will need a controller to be able to be ran with the hardware upgrade.
