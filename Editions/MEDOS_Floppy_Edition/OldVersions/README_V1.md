# MEDOS Floppy edition

[View the project here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_Floppy/)

MEDOS Floppy Edition is an edition of MEDOS meant to act as a virtual floppy drive. It is not going to be designed for physical hardware due to how low usage floppy drives have in 2018 (the project creation date) and later (less than 0.1% of people still use floppy diskettes on modern computers)

It is designed to act as an operating system for floppy drives of capacities of:

> 360K (360 Kilobytes, 360,000 bytes)

> 720K (720 Kilobytes, 720,000 bytes)

> 1.44M (1.44 Megabytes, 1,440 kilobytes, 1,440,000 bytes)

> 2.10M (2.10 Megabytes, 2,100 kilobytes, 2,100,000 bytes)

It is planned to be usable in the formats:

> `*.vfd`

> `*.flp`

And it will run on the following virtual machine clients and hypervisors:

> [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

> [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/)

> [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)

> [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)

> [Microsoft Virtual PC 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4580)

> [Sheepshaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheepShaver)

> [PearPC](https://github.com/sebastianbiallas/pearpc/)
