[View the project here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/MEDOS_HDD/)

MEDOS HDD Edition is an edition of MEDOS meant to act as an operating system for external hard drives. It will also have support for having an Internet connection, and also with the correct hardware, the ability to use your hard drive remotely without plugging it in. A special piece of hardware needs to be added that includes a battery and an antenna.

It is designed to act as an operating system for hard disk drives of capacities of 20 megabytes (20,000 kilobytes, 20,000,000 bytes) to 16 terabytes (16,000 Gigabytes, 16,000,000 Megabytes, 16,000,000,000 kilobytes, 16,000,000,000,000 bytes) (the physical limit of Hard Disk Drives)

It will need a controller to be able to be ran with the hardware upgrade.
