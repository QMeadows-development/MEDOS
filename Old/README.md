# README - For the old directory

The old directory contains older MEDOS build files, and presentations that are no longer needed. They were just lying around, so I decided to put them to some use.

`MEDOS 2` - A planned, uncategorized second edition of MEDOS, that is too incomplete. It was planned to be a graphical version of MEDOS.

`MEDOS HDD Beta` - An old build of the MEDOS HDD beta, it is a copy that is stripped of almost everything except for an unrelated sound effect. I added it in, as it was lying around.

`Presentations/PPTX` - This directory contains an old presentation on the MEDOS project, back when it was completely confidential. I reviewed this last night, it is no longer required, but the information is still up to date, as the project hasn't changed much. It was made in PPTX format, because I didn't have LibreOffice back then, but it will work fine and function the same in LibreOffice Impress and other office suites that support the PPTX format.

Those are the current 3 old modules that were added here.
